## Janus Governance Core

---

## What is Janus?

Janus is a minimal governance layer for human–AI development systems.

It introduces three structural invariants:

• append-only institutional logs  
• dual evidence model (E+ / E−)  
• explicit human authority decisions

Together these enable development environments where actions, decisions, and system states remain traceable, auditable, and deterministically reconstructible.

Janus is a set of stack-agnostic specifications for management systems that require traceable decisions, explicit evidence handling, and audit-ready records. “Management” is used as a superset term for organizational contexts (e.g., government, project, education, business).

Janus is not:
- A runtime, platform, or hosted service
- A product roadmap or marketing artifact
- A legal contract or a substitute for legal review
- A guarantee of compliance or correctness

## Latest Updates

- Deterministic validation suite (Node) demonstrating reproducible Janus Core Lite cases
- 60-second executable proof of the system
- Runtime model documentation
- "What is Janus" overview document
- GitHub Pages section showing the executable proof

### Repository map

Normative specifications (Genesis):

- `core/lite/`: Core Lite canonical spec
- `rfcs/`: RFC 0001–0008
- `docs/`: Architecture + Governance docs
- 60-second runtime proof: [docs/demo-run.md](docs/demo-run.md)

Non-normative historical material:

- `archive/`: Out-of-scope for Genesis semantics

### Deterministic Validation Suite (Node)

This repository includes a minimal, portable deterministic validation suite proving governance evaluation, omission detection, audit writing, and deterministic rebuild.

- [runtimes/demo-node/README.md](runtimes/demo-node/README.md)
- Run: `node runtimes/demo-node/demo.js`
- Suite: `node demos/node/src/run-suite.js`

The suite writes a deterministic summary report to:

- `demos/node/outputs/janus-validation-suite.json`

### High-level principles

- Stack-agnostic Core: Core definitions avoid runtime or vendor assumptions.
- Glossary-first stability: canonical meanings live in `docs/glossary.md` and are treated as the source of semantic truth.
- Append-only records: canonical logs are defined as append-only sequences.
- Separation of concerns: decision authority, evidence, and audit representations are distinct concepts.
- Closed-loop governance: recorded outcomes feed back into future controls and review.
- Human final authority: when a matter requires explicit human accountability, the system records a `HUMAN_DECISION`.

### Status

- Core Lite: v0.1 Draft

### Reading order

1) `docs/glossary.md`
2) `docs/architecture/janus-stack.md`
3) `core/` specifications

### Governance note

Janus defines closed-loop governance mechanics. Final authority remains with designated humans for decisions that require accountability, recorded explicitly as `HUMAN_DECISION`.
