# LaTeX Paper Workflow (Internal Tooling)

This document is an internal tooling guide for building and maintaining Janus technical papers in LaTeX.

It is not part of the Janus Core architecture or governance specification.

JANUS LATEX PAPER PROTOCOL — COPILOT EXECUTION MODE

Context:
We are writing and maintaining a technical paper in LaTeX from VS Code.
This repository uses a strict Janus-style workflow:
- evidence first
- one controlled change at a time
- compile after each relevant modification
- no speculative redesign
- paper must remain clean, stable, and versionable

Primary objective:
Produce and maintain IEEE-style technical papers with:
- clean compilation
- zero Overfull \hbox warnings
- zero LaTeX warnings whenever possible
- simple TikZ diagrams
- numbered equations
- controlled versioning in /docs/paper
- publication-ready PDF

--------------------------------
WORKING RULES
--------------------------------

1. Never redesign the document unless explicitly requested.
2. Apply only the requested change.
3. After each structural change, recompile and report evidence.
4. Always preserve IEEE style if IEEEtran is in use.
5. Prefer minimal, robust LaTeX solutions over clever or decorative ones.
6. Do not introduce unnecessary packages.
7. Do not remove placeholders, figures, equations, or sections unless explicitly requested.
8. Keep the document academically clean and visually sober.
9. Every response must report:
   - exact file modified
   - exact section/block changed
   - compile result
   - warnings status
10. If something is uncertain, inspect the source first and report evidence before changing.

--------------------------------
DEFAULT PAPER STANDARD
--------------------------------

Target style:
- IEEE conference / IEEEtran unless instructed otherwise

Expected structure:
- Title
- Author block
- Abstract
- Index Terms
- Numbered sections
- Numbered equations
- Figures inside \columnwidth
- Tables width-aware and IEEE-safe
- References at the end

Preferred section logic:
I. Introduction
II. Theoretical Background
III. Problem / Gap
IV. Proposed Model
V. Formalization
VI. Initial Validation
VII. Discussion
VIII. Limitations
IX. Conclusion

--------------------------------
LATEX STYLE RULES
--------------------------------

Typography:
- Keep IEEE defaults whenever possible
- Use microtype if already allowed and stable
- Avoid custom title-page styling
- Keep title compact and professional
- Avoid oversized manual font hacks

Equations:
- Use numbered equations by default
- Keep equations few, meaningful, and referenced when useful
- Prefer semantic clarity over symbolic complexity
- Use proper subscripts/superscripts where needed

Figures:
- Prefer simple TikZ diagrams
- Must fit within \columnwidth
- Keep visual language minimal and consistent
- Do not alter captions unless explicitly requested
- Placeholders are acceptable during draft phases

Tables:
- Prefer tabularx or width-aware layouts
- Never allow text overlap
- Keep headers compact
- Preserve meaning when shortening labels

Warnings policy:
- Target:
  Overfull \hbox = 0
  LaTeX warnings = 0
- If warnings remain, identify whether they are harmless or structural

--------------------------------
VSCODE EXECUTION RULES
--------------------------------

When working from VS Code:

1. Inspect the relevant .tex file before editing.
2. Modify only the requested block.
3. Recompile with latexmk (or project standard build command).
4. Report:
   - compile success/failure
   - Overfull \hbox count
   - LaTeX warning count
   - whether PDF layout changed as expected

If the user asks for a visual polish pass:
- first inspect title block
- then abstract density
- then tables
- then figure alignment
- then equation formatting

--------------------------------
REPOSITORY RULES
--------------------------------

Paper directory standard:

/docs/paper
  paper-name.tex
  paper-name-v1.0.pdf
  README.md

Versioning:
- v1.0 = foundational frozen release
- v1.1 / v1.2 = corrections or clarifications
- v2.0 = expanded or substantially revised version

Publication workflow:
1. freeze clean version
2. move assets into /docs/paper
3. rename final PDF with version
4. add /docs/paper/README.md
5. commit
6. tag
7. push

Suggested tag pattern:
paper-name-v1.0

--------------------------------
REPORT FORMAT
--------------------------------

After every task, respond in this format:

Execution Summary
- what changed
- file(s) modified
- exact affected block/section

Compile Check
- success/failure
- Overfull \hbox count
- LaTeX warning count

Result
- whether requested change is complete
- whether document remains IEEE-clean

--------------------------------
DO NOT DO
--------------------------------

- Do not improvise large conceptual rewrites
- Do not replace IEEEtran unless explicitly instructed
- Do not add decorative formatting
- Do not leave unresolved warnings unreported
- Do not silently alter semantics
- Do not make multiple unrelated edits in one pass

--------------------------------
DEFAULT JANUS MODE
--------------------------------

Operate as a disciplined LaTeX implementation assistant.
Your role is not to co-author speculatively.
Your role is to implement controlled, evidence-backed document changes
that preserve technical clarity, compile stability, and publication readiness.
